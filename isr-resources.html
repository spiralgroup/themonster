<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Independent Sales Representative Resource Portal. It contains the tools and resources you'll need to help you integrate successfully into our company. This portal also includes all you'll need to help clients grow their small businesses exponentially. With each product sold, you've given a local small business an opportunity to get in the game.<br><br>


<h2>Showing Enthusiasm for the Product</h2>
<p>Study your product. If you are able to convey knowledge about the product, and to answer questions that customers may have, then they will understand that you really care about the product. If you find the product worthwhile, they are more likely to as well.

•	It is absolutely vital to know your product inside out. If you do not know something a customer asks of you, try saying something like “I don’t know the exact answer for that, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away. What’s the best way to contact you when I find the answer?”

Emphasize the perks of the product to customers. As well as getting good product information to the right people, it is important to translate the product's features into benefits. This makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase the product. Think about things like: [2] 
•	Will the product make the customer’s life easier?
•	Will the product create a sense of luxury?
•	Is the product something that can be enjoyed by many people?
•	Is the product something that can be used for a long time?
Ensure that the product has been adequately explained. If you are not doing direct, person-to-person sales, then you will need to ensure that good product information is supplied via retail packaging, point-of-purchase displays, and any marketing materials. [3] Even if you are selling products directly or making a pitch, having good product information on display will help you convince customers. [4] [5] 
•	Make sure that all product information is informative, true, and complete.
•	Make sure that the language on product packaging and marketing materials is clear, direct, and easy to read.
•	Invest the time and money to ensure that your product, packaging, and marketing materials look good—high-quality photos, vivid colors, etc.<br><br>

As an Independent Sales Representative for Spiral Group, Inc. you are in control of your work life. Therefore, you're encouraged to be task-oriented, focused, and organized.<br><br>
  
Begin by designating a separate workspace. This could be a separate room or space in your home or favorite coffee shop. Separating business and personal space can help put you in a better mindset for getting work done.<br><br>

This section contains a few tips that can be useful while working remotely as an Independent Sales Representative for Spiral Group, Inc.

1. Be clear on expectations. Make sure you understand what is expected from you as an ISR. Ask questions to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication.

2. Be responsive. Send a prompt reply whenever you get an email. Attend *online meetings and conference calls, and engage with colleagues in our online community forum.

*As a team, we will determine the best times to have regularly scheduled online meetings and conference calls.

3. Communicate your progress, or any challenges you're facing, by scheduling regular check-ins that are convenient for you.

4. Don't work too many hours. Set an alarm to alert you that it's the end of your workday.

5. Have a routine. Work at set times, but be flexible. This will also make it easier for colleagues to collaborate with you. One of the most rewarding aspects of being a remote worker is your flexibility.<br><br>

Independent Sales Representatives work directly with local small businesses to help them achieve their goals through our various products and ad programs. They're responsible for identifying and contacting businesses throughout the tri-state area (Illinois, Indiana & Wisconsin) that would benefit from our products and services; help determine their needs and business aspirations; and customize every sale to accommodate their wishes.<br><br>

Success in this role is measured by exceeding monthly sales goals (*those you set for yourself), honesty, professional ethics, consistently staying ahead of certain daily metrics, asking probing questions, anticipating customer objections, and dealing with rejection professionally.<br><br>

*Why would you be encouraged to set your own sales goals? Simple. You know how much work you can realistically accomplish. You're an independent contractor, and if you depend on this contract to provide the kind of money needed to live the life you want, then you will set your sales goals accordingly.  I am grateful for all sales. With that stated, the Independent Sales Rep (ISR) who accumulates the most sales in a 30-day period will set the standard.<br><br>

To learn about our profit sharing program, see "Features, Benefits & Advantages of the SG MarketPlace for Independent Sales Reps" located in "The SG MarketPlace FBA's" module.<br><br>

Prepare Yourself to be Successful

Study our products. If you are able to convey knowledge about our products to prospects and answer their questions, they will understand that you care. If you find our products worthwhile, they will also see the value.<br><br>

However, if you're faced with a question you can't answer, then tell the prospect “I don’t know the exact answer for that, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away. What’s the best way to contact you when I find the answer?”<br><br>

Please do not guess an answer. Do not hesitate to call me right away. I am available everyday, from 8am to 8pm.

Emphasize the *features, benefits & advantages of our products. This makes it easier for the prospect to see why they should purchase the product.

*See "Features, Benefits & Advantages of the SG MarketPlace for Sellers" located in "The SG MarketPlace FBA's" module.</p>

<h1>Our Product Portfolio</h1>
  
<p>There's not one small business business out there that won't benefit from promoting and selling their products in the SG MarketPlace.<br><br>


Product selling focuses more on the individual item, while service selling focuses on satisfying a customer’s needs.
Selling services focuses much more the relationship between the client and the service provider.<br><br>

Selling a product doesn't have to be complicated. At its most basic level, a sales program is defined principally by what you sell, who you sell it to and how you sell it.<br><br>

Beyond that, sales involves staying focused on the details of your product and customers. As a sales program continues you will want to keep paying attention to changing trends and the needs or desires of your customers. By observing these changes you will be able to adjust your program and keep your sales strong.<br><br>

There is not one small business that won’t benefit from our high-quality Small Business Showcase Webpages. Even if they already have a website. Selling in our marketplace, via their Small Business Showcase WebPages, is an easy and economical way for small businesses to get their products in front of a larger local audience.<br><br>


SG Listing Service

Almost half of all searches are local, and nearly 90% of searches on mobile devices are local. With so many people searching for businesses near them, every small business needs a local listing. A local listing will make it easier for people to find their business when they do a local search, no matter what device they are using. As a result, they'll enjoy an increase in calls, visits, and sales.<br><br>

We developed the SG Listing Service to help small businesses grow by increasing brand awareness. We manually register their company in only the top electronic business directories such as Bing, FourSquare, Google, and YP.com. We put in the work of setting up their local business listings so they don't have to.<br><br>

We're offering the SG Listing Service free of charge to the first 100 clients we onboard.

SG Local Ad Services

Finding the right advertising solution for small businesses can be complicated and time-consuming. With so many online advertising compensation models, it's no wonder. Nevertheless, it's still important to educate local consumers about their brand, products, and services through online marketing efforts. That's why we developed SG Local Ad Services. Our new ad products and pricing model were created with the small business owner in mind.<br><br>

Small business owners never have to worry about paying for CPA's, CPC's, CPI's, etc. Although tracking the progress of an ad campaign is crucial, the best way to know if an ad is truly yielding the results they want is by observing how many people actually made a purchase, subscribed to their mailing list, and simply followed the instructions of their call-to-action (CTA) buttons.<br><br>

Other ways to track the effectiveness of a campaign are to: (1) encourage consumers to download and print coupons from their website to encourage offline sales; (2) offer discount codes for customers who shop their online store; and (3) send offers to consumers using an email marketing service. All three are included with each of our Small Business Showcase WebPages Plans.<br><br>

Our Ad Products

1. Scrolling Footer Logo Ads – Only $1 A Day

A company's logo is the most valuable advertising asset they can use in their marketing efforts. A well-designed logo speaks to consumers in an artistic and visually stimulating way. It gives them an idea of their company's personality and makes their brand recognizable. These ads appear on all SBS WebPages within the same and complimentary business categories.<br><br>

2. Branded Category Ads

    Standard, Only $99 per month
    Premium, Only $139 per month

Brand advertising is one way to get long-term recognition by establishing brand identity and credibility. The goal of a Branded Category Ad is to connect with prospects intellectually and emotionally so they're motivated to take action when they see a company's performance-based ads. Branded Category Ads appear within the same and complimentary business categories in the SG MarketPlace. These ads are not placed on Small Business Showcase WebPages.<br><br>

 

3. The Prestige

    Both Ad Products for 90 days, Only $299

Get both Ad Products for 90 days for just $299. Purchased separately, the customer pays $387. In addition to the Prestige, we suggest adding our Operational Marketing Assessment (OMA). When they combine the OMA with both Ad Products, they'll capture an immediate ROI.<br><br>

Business Excellence Tools

Our Business Excellence tools were designed to assist small business owners in preparing their teams and operational infrastructures so they’re not growing their businesses haphazardly.<br><br>

Our Business Excellence Tools

1. Mystery Shopping Program, Only $99.

    The cost to conduct each shop is determined during the initial consultation.

A Mystery Shopping Program can provide a small business with the kind of insights that large companies use to improve the customer experience. They excel because they know consistency is key to creating a customer experience that wins trust and fosters loyalty.<br><br>

We design and implement a mystery shopping program that provides honest and in-depth views from the customers' perspective. It will help identify operational challenges, recognize the high achievers among their workforce, and incline their small business toward excellence. We train our shoppers to deliver a comprehensive, professional, and unbiased view of their operation which allows them to understand how customers experience their brand.<br><br>

2. On-Site Mock Health Inspection (for restaurateurs)

It is likely that every organization in the food industry will undergo regular public health inspections conducted by local government health departments. We can help restaurateurs prepare for an official City of Chicago Health Department Inspection.<br><br>

During their Mock Health Inspection, we work closely with them to ensure food safety, while prioritizing any missed opportunities within their last health inspection report. We pay close attention to the factors that could lead to potential Health Code Violations. We help them understand the underlying causes of food safety problems and recognize staff that may need additional training.<br><br>

 

3. On-Site Operational Marketing Assessment

When a small business wants to expand its customer base, we use the Operational Marketing Assessment to help determine their level of preparedness. It enables them to increase the effectiveness of their marketing efforts by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their business systems; by examining how workflow and structure affect customer service; and by understanding how their business performs against competitors.</p>
