<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Independent Sales Consultant Resource Portal. The resources needed to help you integrate successfully into our company and help our clients grow their small businesses exponentially can be found here.<br><br>

Your primary goal is to work directly with local small businesses to help them achieve their goals through our various products and ad programs. You're responsible for identifying and contacting businesses throughout the tri-state area &#151; Illinois, Indiana & Wisconsin &#151; that would benefit from our products and services; help determine their needs and business aspirations; and customize every sale to accommodate their wishes. With each product sold, you've given a local small business an opportunity to get their products and services in front of a larger local audience.</p>

<hr />

<h2>PREPARE FOR SUCCESS</h2>

<p>
&#8226; Study our products. If you are able to convey knowledge about our products to customers and answer their questions, they will know you care. If you find our products worthwhile, they will also see the value. As well as getting accurate product information to decision-makers, it is important to translate our product's features into benefits. This makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase our products.<br><br>

&#8226; Ask questions. If faced with a question you can't answer, refrain from guessing. Instead, tell the customer “I don’t know the exact answer for that, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you. What’s the best way to contact you when I find the answer?” Then, contact me or one of your colleagues right away.<br><br>

&#8226; Be clear on expectations. Make sure you understand what is expected from you. Ask questions to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication.<br><br>

&#8226; Be responsive. Send a prompt reply whenever you receive email and voicemail messages. Attend online meetings and conference calls, and engage with colleagues. Communicate your progress, or any challenges you're facing, by scheduling regular check-ins that are convenient for you.<br><br>

&#8226; You have great insights. Share your ideas and contribute towards improved coordination between us all.<br><br>

&#8226; Have a routine. Work at set times, but be flexible. This will also make it easier for colleagues to collaborate with you. Don't work too many hours. Set an alarm to alert you that it's the end of your workday. One of the most rewarding aspects of being a remote worker is your flexibility.<br><br>

&#8226; Value time. Time is a valuable resource, but its true value lies in our ability to use it wisely. One way to use time more effectually is by reducing administrative tasks. Know how to avoid spending too much time in spreadsheets; how to untangle yourself from unnecessary paperwork; and when to part ways with a volatile customer relationship management system.<br><br>

&#8226; Cultivate healthy habits. Sharp-minded reps realise that sitting all day, whether in an office or a car, negatively effects their postures and moods. Take breaks between tasks and move around strategically to clear your mind and de-stress your body. Being present and positive on the job requires proper sleep. Vow to get between 7-8 hours of sleep every night in order to function optimally.<br><br>

&#8226; Have a designated workspace. Separating business and personal space can help put you in a better mindset for getting work done.<br><br>

&#8226; Keep promises. Trust is central to all healthy relationships. Follow-up conversations, make realistic promises, and remain transparent at all times.</p>

<p class="topic">Online Marketing</p>

<p class="topic">Online Marketing</p>

<p>We developed the SG Listing Service to help local small businesses grow by increasing brand awareness. We manually register their companies in only the top electronic business directories such as Bing, FourSquare, Google, and YP.com. We put in the work of setting up their local business listings so they don't have to. We're offering the SG Listing Service free to the first 25 clients we onboard. $99.99, One-Time Payment.</p>
<hr />

<h2>SG LOCAL AD SERVICES</h2>

<p>Finding the right advertising solution for small businesses can be complicated and time-consuming. With so many online advertising compensation models, it's no wonder. Nevertheless, it's still important for them to educate local consumers about their brand, products, and services through online marketing efforts. That's why we developed SG Local Ad Services. Our new ad products and pricing model were created with the small business owner in mind.<br><br>

Small business owners never have to worry about paying for CPA's, CPC's, CPI's, etc. Although tracking the progress of an ad campaign is crucial, the best way to know if an ad is truly yielding the results they want is by observing how many people actually made a purchase, subscribed to their mailing list, and simply followed the instructions of their call-to-action (CTA) buttons.</p><br>
