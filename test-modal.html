If you start with a clear goal in mind, firm understanding of your brand, and willingness to experiment, you can effectively use your new Special Offers WebPage to meet your objectives, build customer loyalty, and increase revenues.<br><br>

Building an online business will generally involve a lot of experimentation to understand what works best. Use the button below for information on the types of offers, coupons, and discounts we can incoprorate into your Special Offers WebPage.</p><br>

<button onclick="document.getElementById('id88').style.display='block'" class="btn btn-primary btn-block w3-hover-shadow" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;font-family:roboto;font-size:14px;color:#222;letter-spacing:.5px;border:none;border-radius:2px;text-shadow:0 0 1px #222;padding:8px;margin:0;text-decoration:none;">&#10144; SPECIAL OFFERS WEBPAGE GUIDE</button>

<p class="topic2">If you start with a clear goal in mind, firm understanding of your brand, and willingness to experiment, you can effectively use your new Special Offers WebPage to meet your objectives, build customer loyalty, and increase revenues.<br><br>

If your goal is to compete directly against another competitive alternative, then consider applying a competitive strategy by creating a latent sales opportunity. Kevin Graff of <a href="https://www.graffretail.com/" target="_blank">Graff Retail</a> suggests BOPIS (Buy Online, Pickup In-Store) opportunities to increase sales. Train your staff to leverage these particular interactions with customers by pre-planning what could/should be suggested with the item being picked up.<br><br> 

BOPIS also provides an opportunity for you to create a pleasant and personalized in-store experience for the online shopper. Although huge opportunities to increase sales lie in BOPIS, how many small business owners with actual retail locations will take advantage of it?<br><br>

If your goal is to  position yourself as a higher-end brand, then consider pursuing opportunities where you can provide a high-value solution. Using minimum purchase discounts is an effective upselling tactic to encourage customers to spend more. You can offer minimum purchase discounts for specific products and services, or free shipping on all orders over $100.<br><br>

Ultimately, you will need to consider the kind of offers that are right for your brand. Building an online business will generally involve a lot of experimentation to understand what works best. The best approach is to choose a goal for every campaign and offer, start small, and measure the results.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-family:roboto;font-size:16px;color:#222;letter-spacing:.5px;text-shadow:0 0 1px #000;margin:0 0 5px 0;padding:0;">The Challenge We All Face</p>

<p class="topic2">When it comes time to actually do the work of creating discounts and special promotional offers for your Special Offers WebPage, you may have to struggle through the process of determining how much the discounts should be worth. This is where my innate customer comes in handy. I visualize myself as the customer to determine the kind of discount or special promotional offer that would be beneficial to me, as a small business owner.<br><br>

For instance, I spent almost two years creating and shaping an online Job Readiness Training program. It is provided free of charge to anyone just for enrolling. In addition, those who successfully complete the courses receive a free Certificate of Completion, which can be used alongside their other self-marketing materials (resume, cover letter, etc.).<br><br>

When developing my business model, I began to realize that some of these courses can actually be used to train the workforces of many small businesses. So, I decided to offer certain modules for this very purpose. These extracts have been collectively labeled Workforce Training Courses. They are offered free of charge on our <a href="https://spiralgroup.github.io/themonster/special-offers.html" target="_blank">Special Offers</a> page to small business owners who purchase any Small Business Showcase WebPages Plan from us.<br><br>

By visualizing myself as a customer in need of a professional online presence, and one who could definitely use a structured online training program for her staff, I could see the benefits of making that purchase. The task of creating an online presence for my small business has vanished, and I don't have to worry about purchasing certain training courses for my team.</p><br>

<p class="topic2">
There are many kinds of discounts and offers you can use on your Spiral Group, Inc. Special Offers WebPage. Below is a list of the ones we believe will help guide you in the most profitable direction.</p>

<hr />

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Percentage-Based Discounts</p>

<p class="topic2">This can include small incentive percentages like 5% or 10% off, larger discounts to really drive sales like 20% and 25%, or significant percentages like 50%+ to liquidate merchandise that’s old or isn’t moving.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Free Shipping Offers</p>

<p class="topic2">Shipping costs are one major reason for shopping cart abandonment. Offering free shipping is a great way to mitigate this and increase conversions. You can use free shipping offers in conjunction with a minimum purchase requirement to increase your average order value.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Free Gift Offers</p>

<p class="topic2">A free gift with a purchase can be a great way to provide additional value to the customer. If used strategically, it can also be used to increase average order size and/or to get rid of product that isn’t moving.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Weekly & Monthly Discounts</p>

<p class="topic2">Traditional sales used to drive conversions. The online photo department at Walgreens has <a href="https://photo.walgreens.com/store/deals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">weekly sales</a>.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Prelaunch Offers</p>

<p class="topic2">If you’re in the prelaunch stage of your Small Business or launching a new product or service, you can use prelaunch offers to drive traffic and peak interest, turning new customers into loyal customers.<br><br>

Consider offering free gift cards in exchange for customers’ email addresses and time to fill out a brief survey. You can kick off this initiative by manually reaching out to potential respondents on your social networks.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Holiday & Seasonal Deals</p>

<p class="topic2">Throughout the entire year there are national and commemorative holidays that provide an opportunity to share relevant discounts and offers with customers. Online retailer <a href="http://bluskincare.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Blu Skin Care</a> regularly makes use of holidays to promote offers to their visitors and past customers. They promote these using email and social media.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Email/Newsletter Subscription Offer</p>

<p class="topic2">Building an email list is important for successful online retailers. By providing an offer in exchange for a visitor's email address, you increase the chance of a conversion. Consider offering 10% off their first order for new subscribers to your email list. Used strategically, your list can be invaluable for increasing brand awareness, fostering customer loyalty, and meeting sales goals.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Social Media Incentives</p>

<p class="topic2">One of the most challenging aspects of operating a new online store is getting the word out. Giving visitors and customers an incentive to share your store within their social circles can be an effective way to create a buzz around your brand. Online retailer <a href="https://www.truxxit.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Truxx</a> offers customers $5 off their next purchase in exchange for visitors sharing about the brand and experience on Facebook.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Referral Promos</p>

<p class="topic2">People are more likely to purchase from you if referred by a friend or family member. Use this to your advantage by encouraging referrals. You can choose to give a deal to the person referring, the person being referred, or both.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; First-Time Shopper Offer</p>

<p class="topic2">This kind of promotion could be the nudge a first-time visitor needs to be converted into a paying customer. Online retailer <a href="https://www.clearly.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clearly</a> provides all new visitors with a 50% discount on prescription glasses, 15% on contact lenses, and free shipping. <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DODOcase</a>, an online manufacturer of iPad cases, offers 10% off your first purchase.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Minimum Purchase Discount</p>

<p class="topic2">An offer based on the total value of a shopping cart is an effective upselling tactic to encourage customers to spend more. You can offer minimum purchase discounts for your products and services.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Exclusive Social Offers</p>

<p class="topic2">Exclusive offers on your social networks can be a great way to build customer loyalty with those who follow you. This tactic also provides a reason for new people to follow and subscribe to your social channels, allowing you to market to them in the future.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Customer Loyalty Offers</p>

<p class="topic2">Rewarding customer loyalty is crucial. This can be accomplished by simply sending your best customers a personal email containing a discount or credit.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Coupons for Purchasing In-Store</p>

<p class="topic2">Just as you can drive online sales with offers, you can also drive in-store sales. This can be at your brick-and-mortar location, or at in-person events such as festivals, fairs, expos, trade shows, etc. Use your email list as a marketing tool to send coupons to subscribers containing discounts for in-store purchases. Consider accepting these coupons even after the expiration date.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Event Attendance Offers</p>

<p class="topic2">If you host events, you can reward attendees with discounts or free gifts. This can help cultivate the relationship with engaged customers, increase customer loyalty, and encourage attendance for your next event.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; Customer Milestone Discounts</p>

<p class="topic2">These milestones could be personal to a customer such as a birthday or wedding anniversary. Other milestones can celebrate the relationship you’ve built with one another &#151; the anniversary of the customer’s first purchase or spending a certain amount of money. Consider rewarding your customers when they have reached certain milestones with extra discounts and free gifts.</p><br>

<p class="topic4">&#9900; You're Ready</p>
<p class="topic2">We hope this guide inspires you to create some of the most amazing discounts and special offers that will drive frequent and paying customers to your new Spiral Group, Inc. Small Business Showcase WebPages.</p>

It’s becoming more and more simple to create a website that looks well-designed and professional. There is an expectation for a professional website from professional companies.

<p class="topic2">The benefits of choosing a marketing firm is that they typically offer all the services you need from branding and design to building and maintaining your website.


your website is a critical component to your business, and one that should reflect your brand’s style while remaining incredibly functional and user friendly. It is not just a business card, but an engaging way for your clients to experience your business’s offering.

Managing the process of your website’s creation

Post-launch follow up and maintenance


How many rounds, or series, of edits do you get for each stage of the process? The type of edits varies based on the part of the project you’re reviewing. They may allow you to request a completely new design if you didn’t like either of the first two at all, but when it comes to copy editing they may specify only one round of edits prior to finalization.

If you have agreed upon communication for feedback and review to occur by email or a project management system, be sure that is both how you receive and provide feedback.

Additionally, if you’re not happy with any part of the process, notify them immediately. You do not want to wait until after the project is done, after you’ve given your approval to move forward, to express your thought.

The company you hire wants to create a great product for you, so just ensure open and honest communication with them. As professionals, they will not take your feedback personally, so speak up if you don’t like something or have concerns


The great benefit to hiring a professional to do both the design and build is the efficiency of time between design and build stage – no muddling through files transfers and updates, and no confusion in how to design for web use.</p>
