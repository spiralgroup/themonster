<b>LEARN FOOD SERVICE BASICS.<br>
ENROLL IN OUR EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION &#124; PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROGRAM.</b></p>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
Spiral Group's Food Service Basics Training Program was designed to teach individuals who would like to obtain employment in the Foodservice Industry as Food Service Workers. 

Whether it’s a quick-service establishment or school cafeteria, a restaurant doesn’t just sell food&#151;it also provides service and atmosphere. Part of your job as a food service worker is to ensure that your tasks are completed in a timely and efficient manner. Doing your part will lend to creating a pleasant experience for the customers. 

Good staff members are one of the keys to a successful restaurant. Although you may have interviewed for a specific position, you may be expected to assume other duties as determined by the current needs of the operation. Nevertheless, you will be trained to bring these tasks to completion. If you discover this is the case, consider yourself very lucky, indeed.

Entering your new workplace with a teachable mentality and a professional, can do spirit will not be overlooked by the employer. There are many reasons that you may be asked to assume job duties that you had not anticipated at the time of hiring, especially in the food industry. One example is the employee who is responsible for prepping the vegetables for the salad bar had to be restricted from the restaurant due to an illness that was contracted. So, your first week on your new job may require that you learn how to do the work required to prep the salad bar items until the sick employee is allowed to return. This will show your new employer your willingness to work as a team player.

You may also be required to assist with the training of other staff members as soon as you have learned a new task yourself. During busy, or peak, periods managers direct and supervise staff members. That's why it's essential to learn to manage your own workplace performance so that the manager will begin noticing that you do require much supervision. In addition, taking initiative will also show your manager your ability to think on your feet and problem solve.

In addition to dealing with the staff and clientele, managers keep track of the restaurant’s inventory of food and beverages and order new supplies when necessary.

They make sure the restaurant is clean and well-maintained and ready for health inspections.
Top restaurants operate like well-oiled machines, and busy kitchens can be compared to military operations in terms of efficiency and the chain of command.  A diverse range of roles and functions must be filled and performed simultaneously for a restaurant to consistently provide high-quality service to guests.  A strict hierarchy of managers, supervisors and individual contributors work together like clockwork to ensure that a restaurant runs smoothly while confronting the challenges of the food-service industry.



Working Conditions
Restaurant managers are employed by hotels, department store restaurants, diners, cafeterias, trendy eateries, coffee shops, and specialty, fast food, full-service, and highway restaurants. Some managers own as well as manage their own restaurant.

Managers spend most of their time in and around the restaurant, overseeing the staff and making themselves available to customers.

People in this profession work long, irregular hours. On evenings and weekends, when most people are finishing work and beginning to relax, restaurant managers are often at their busiest part of the day. A 9 to 11-hour workday is common.

Managers who work for restaurants or cafeterias located in department stores, factories, or office buildings generally work more regular hours. This is because the operating hours of these establishments usually conform to the operating hours of the business or facility they serve.

In large restaurants, where there may be several managers, managers can take up to 30 vacation days a year. Smaller restaurants, however, typically have only one manager. These managers, who in many cases also own the restaurant, get very little time off, especially if they are just starting up the business.

Keeping everything running smoothly at a restaurant can be stressful. It can be especially difficult to deal with angry customers or uncooperative employees.
